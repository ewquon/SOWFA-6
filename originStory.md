What do you think we should call the One Unified Solver?

**Dries 1:24 PM**<br>
`AwesomeSolver`<br>
I kind of like the simplicity of `ABLSolver`
or do you want a new name?

**Matt Churchfield 1:28 PM**<br>
I like `ABLSolver`, too, but does that capture the nature of all that it does?<br>
`windSolver`<br>
`windEnergySolver`<br>
`windPlantSolver`<br>
Still, the ring of `ABLSolver` is nicest to me.

**Dries 1:29 PM**<br>
It solves atmospheric boundary layer flow<br>
if you want to put wind turbines or buildings or a forest in there, it still calculates the atmospheric flow fields<br>
so `ABLSolver` makes sense to me<br>
if you really want a new name, Iâ€™d pick `windEnergySolver` from your list. `windPlant` is too stringent because you could also look at one turbine

**Matt Churchfield 1:31 PM**<br>
We could do something off the wall like `JoeBidenSolver`.

**Dries 1:32 PM**<br>
`MadtSolver`<br>
refering to you and the fact that it is a crazy mad awesome solver
sorry, terrible option<br>
I take it back

**Matt Churchfield 1:33 PM**<br>
We can just call it `vanilla`.

**Dries 1:33 PM**<br>
`superDeliciousVanilla`

It looks really good that way.<br>
Super simple, Super delicious!
